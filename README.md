This is just a normal terraforming template to provision nginx web server through file provisioner using SSH and adding Localhost Public IP address to AWS Default security Group inboud rules to associate the traffic  while it's lauching the EC2 Instance for the first time.
I've used different Modules to keep it clean, Tidy and re-usable of code.
Server is up and running using terraform
